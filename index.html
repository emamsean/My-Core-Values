                    <p>This app is designed to help you uncover your core human values by exploring what matters most to you. Through a series of questions, you'll reflect on 24 key values, rating their importance to you. Each value will be presented one at a time, with three probing questions to help you think deeply about its role in your life.</p>
                    <p>You'll rate each question on a scale from 1 (least important) to 5 (most important), with 3 being indifferent. At the end, you'll receive a personalized report identifying your top core values, explaining them through psychological frameworks like Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and Schwartz’s Value Theory, and highlighting situations that may make you happy or upset based on those values.</p>
